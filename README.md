# ðŸ›¸ Extraterrestrial Civilization Estimator

**UC Berkeley MIDS â€“ Probability & Data Science Project**

This project uses the Drake Equation to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The analysis models key variables such as star formation rates, planetary conditions, and technological lifespan.
